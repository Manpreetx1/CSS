At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Because I still miss someone

Oh, I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone

I still miss someone

Oh, I never got over those blue eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
I still miss someone
